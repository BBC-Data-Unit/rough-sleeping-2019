# Homeless on streets: Figures fall but 'root causes' remain

In January 2019 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-47059450) on new rough sleeping data which showed a slight fall on the previous year. The figures are only a single night snapshot, with councils either counting or estimating the number of rough sleepers.

The story included a 'Reality Check' analysis explaining the statistical context to the figures: 

> In England councils choose one night in October or November to carry out a street count - they will physically go out and count the people they see sleeping rough on streets in tents or doorways.

> Some councils choose instead to make an estimate based on how many people are known to local services like homelessness charities - for example, in rural areas where it may be more difficult to physically count people.

> That means anyone who they don't spot - and many homeless people choose to hide themselves for their own safety - or anyone who spends that night walking around, on a night bus or sofa surfing won't be counted.

> It also doesn't include anyone staying that night in a hostel or shelter.

> There are many more people who are homeless but don't sleep rough, staying instead in temporary accommodation like bed and breakfasts.
